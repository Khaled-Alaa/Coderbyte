# Coderbyte - HTML Basic Table

We provided a simple HTML template. Your goal is to replace the h1 tag with a table. The table should have 3 rows and 3 columns. The table headers (which counts as the first row and should use the <th> tags) should be FirstName, LastName, and Age. The other two rows should be filled in with some random name data and age data, as long as the names contain only alphabetical characters and the age cell contains only a numeric value.

Submit your code once it is complete and our system will validate your output.
