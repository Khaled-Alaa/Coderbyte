# Coderbyte - AB Check

Have the function ABCheck(str) take the str parameter being passed and return the string true if the characters a and b are separated by exactly 3 places anywhere in the string at least once (ie. "lane borrowed" would result in true because there is exactly three characters between a and b). Otherwise return the string false.

## Examples

```
Input: "after badly"
Output: false
```

```
Input: "Laura sobs"
Output: true
```
