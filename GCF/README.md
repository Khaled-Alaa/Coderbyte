Have the function GCF(arr) take the array of numbers stored in arr which will always contain only two positive integers, and return the greatest common factor of them. For example: if arr is [45, 12] then your program should return 3. There will always be two elements in the array and they will be positive integers.

## Examples

```
Input: [1, 6]
Output: 1
```

```
Input: [12, 28]
Output: 4
```
