# Coderbyte - Second GreatLow

Have the function SecondGreatLow(arr) take the array of numbers stored in arr and return the second lowest and second greatest numbers, respectively, separated by a space. For example: if arr contains [7, 7, 12, 98, 106] the output should be 12 98. The array will not be empty and will contain at least 2 numbers. It can get tricky if there's just two numbers!

## Examples

```
Input: [1, 42, 42, 180]
Output: 42 42
```

```
Input: [4, 90]
Output: 90 4
```
