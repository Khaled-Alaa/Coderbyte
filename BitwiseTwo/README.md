# Coderbyte - Bitwise Two

Have the function BitwiseTwo(strArr) take the array of strings stored in strArr, which will only contain two strings of equal length that represent binary numbers, and return a final binary string that performed the bitwise AND operation on both strings. A bitwise AND operation places a 1 in the new string where there is a 1 in both locations in the binary strings, otherwise it places a 0 in that spot. For example: if strArr is ["10111", "01101"] then your program should return the string "00101"

## Examples

```
Input: ["100", "000"]
Output: 000
```

```
Input: ["10100", "11100"]
Output: 10100
```
