# Coderbyte - String Merge

Have the function StringMerge(str) read the str parameter being passed which will contain a large string of alphanumeric characters with a single asterisk character splitting the string evenly into two separate strings. Your goal is to return a new string by pairing up the characters in the corresponding locations in both strings. For example: if str is "abc1*kyoo" then your program should return the string akbyco1o because a pairs with k, b pairs with y, etc. The string will always split evenly with the asterisk in the center.

## Examples

```
Input: "aaa*bbb"
Output: ababab
```

```
Input: "123hg*aaabb"
Output: 1a2a3ahbgb
```
